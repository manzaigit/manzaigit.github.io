Somehow I feel that we’re the generation that are sandwiched in between traditional ML and DL. 
There’s probably a lot we don’t know about traditional ML as compared to our 'seniors'. How many of the 'younger generation' can claim to have a good understanding of both? Are they both important? Should we just learn DL and extend it? 
They’ll probably tell us to know some ML, since they understand it pretty well.

And we started at a bad time (~2016) when Tensorflow was hard to crack and Caffe was a pain to set up for a first year CS student.

Younger people have it better these days 👴. 

But TF + Keras is in such a mess. All these changes might make sense to the developers (and they did try to clean it up), but for people that used their API over the past years... At least there's always virtualenv and version control.
