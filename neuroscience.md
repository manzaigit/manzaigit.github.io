* Different Views of the Brain
* Workflows in Brain Image Analysis
* Development and Degeneration

1. Anatomy (Macro to micro and back to macro)


2. What data can we get? 

    When drawing insights from brain images using ML techniques, make sure number of subjects (or at least, samples) is not too small.
