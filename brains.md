It's all about brains! 

1. Anatomy
Macro to micro

- control all
- 86 billion neurons 

Cerebral Cortex -> Neocortex
- most recently evolved, in mammals, for sight, hearing, language, processing of sensory input

Cerebellum
- 70 bil, small but very dense ; fine motor skills, complex movement 

Brain Stem -> Medulla Oblongata
- autonomic function (breathe, digest, heart, swallow, sneeze)

2. What data can we get? 

3. Current State

// We're still at the stage where researchers perform experiments and find that some actions cause areas of the brain to be activiated. However, we have very few unifying theories
