NN is likely a young child that learns whatever you teach them without ‘thinking’ about it. ‘Mindless’ pattern recognition and matching. To learn like humans, we need mature models that can **discern ‘noise’ or anomalous observations/data (bad data)** and not learn from them. 

There are many hyperparameters, but some have a larger impact than others
(to elaborate)
