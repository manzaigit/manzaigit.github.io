I'm a 1st year PhD student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I've done my undergraduate degrees in Business and Computer Science in NTU as well.

My key research interests are within the intersection of Neuroscience and Computer Science, specifically **Multimodal Brain Image Analysis**, **Representation Learning** and **Computational Neuroscience**. Also, I do keep an eye on advancements in Quantum Computing and issues related to Green Finance.

Beyond academic interests, I like going on random walks, attending concerts and summarizing what I've observed and learnt - and that's why this blog exists today! :)

## About this blog

This blog is a compilation of what I've learnt during my time in University. The amount of content that we have to go through in our years in University can be overwhelming at times and after graduation, many of us do not remember much about what we've learnt. Thus, the ultimate goal is to create a concise point of reference (e.g. content summaries) from which I can re-visit concepts that I've learnt. In the spirit of open-source, I've decided to release this content to the public too! :)

Beyond CS, I'll also share what I've learnt and my thoughts on various areas, grouped into 3 pillars:

**Data Science / Artifical Intelligence**
* Math (just enough to understand the other topics well)
* Computers (How Computers Work, basic software engineering, basic cybersecurity)
* Data Analytics and Machine Learning (theory and practice in businesses)
* Deep Learning Applications

**Brains**
* Computational Neuroscience
* Neuromorphic Computing
* Brain-Computer Interfaces

**Foresights**
* Entrepreneurship (Design Thinking, Idea to Product, Financing)
* Education (Study Strategies, Teaching Paradigms, Shaping Thoughts)
* Environmentalism and Green Financing 

Each page will be regularly updated, and posts will be made when there's a significant update to one of the pages. Since the motivation is to 

Enjoy reading, and do correct any mistakes if you spot any! :)
