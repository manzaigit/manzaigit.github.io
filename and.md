There are two main ways to view the integration of AI and Neuroscience.
* AI
* Neuroscience-inspired AI 

How do we go one step further to make machines learn more effectively? 
1. Much progress in CV and NLP are unimodal in nature - we seek to achieve higher accuracy. With these models, we can
2. However, there are areas where classifers are not doing well

Humans (with matured brains) are, in many occasions, 
We learn to process information simultaneously from multiple modalities: vision, hearing, touch (texture and heat) and these information are likely to be combined 

Although we don't fully understand how the brain process these information such that 'understanding' happens, ...

At present, 


Accelerating few-shot learning in NN: if predict correctly (during training), get an additional bonus / boost / heavier weight / increase in LR for that mini-epoch(?) but this boost should be limited i.e. decay quickly, decay can be a hyperparameter \[facilitation\]

N has ST/LT synaptic plasticity, but NN is static.
- N receives information continuously, decays continuously too
- NN receives information very intensively and does not change thereafter (there's no continual input?)


What do you need to create 'terminator'
- Advanced robotics system with accurate senses and fine motor control to interact with environment 
- Sustainable power source to run computational engines (GPU/TPU) + receptors and effectors
- Sufficent memory storage to keep data
- Repair itself from wear and tear (knowing when it will break down, creating the replacement and performing the replacement)
