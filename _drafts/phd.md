Why is a PhD tough?

It seems like coursework (only 6 modules, deeper but it's only 6!)

Besides it, you have to do other stuff (e.g. research integrity, modules on English proficiency and teaching)
You'll need to come up with a proposal, find a thesis advisory committee

You'll probably need to work with the senior PhD students or Research Fellows in the lab

You have your own thesis work

if you do cross-disciplinary work, a lot of things to catch up on
