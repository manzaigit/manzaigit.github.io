I'm Yihao, a 1st year PhD student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I've done my undergraduate degrees (Business and Computer Science) in NTU as well, with specializations in Business Analytics, Data Science and Intelligent Systems. <!-- Here's my [CV]() and [Resume]() -->

My key research interests are within the intersection of Computer Science and Neuroscience, specifically **Multimodal Neuroimaging Analysis** and **Multiview Representation Learning**. 

Beyond academic interests, I like going for random walks, attending concerts and engaging in some futures thinking. I like putting ideas together (especially from different disciplines) and I do have a habit of summarizing what I've observed and learnt - that's why this blog exists today!

## about this blog

This blog is a compilation of what I've learnt during my time in University. The amount of content that we have to go through during University can be overwhelming at times and after graduation, many of us do not remember much about what we've learnt. We don't have to remember everything, but it'd be a useful exercise to figure out how to represent information in a form that allows us to recall what we've learnt and understood previously. And we'd want to do so as quickly as possible so that we can make the most optimal and timely decision in life. Thus, it will be useful to create a concise point of reference / content summaries. The summaries will include (mostly) links that I've found useful, short notes about stuff I've learnt that's not covered by existing articles, and my thoughts on various areas (grouped into 3 pillars):

**AI** ðŸ¤–
* Math and Statistics (just enough to understand the other topics well)
* Data Analytics and Machine Learning (theory and practice in businesses)
* Knowledge Representation and Deep Learning Applications

**Neuroscience** ðŸ§ 
* Different Views of the Brain
* Workflows in Brain Image Analysis
* Neurodevelopment and Neurodegeneration

**Foresights** ðŸ”­
* Entrepreneurship (Design Thinking, Idea to Product, Financing)
* Education (Study Strategies, Teaching Paradigms, Shaping Thoughts)
* Environmental Sustainability and Green Financing 

It's too huge a task to create original content for each of these pillars and sub-pillars.
Instead, the focus of this blog is to curate content of decent quality such that an expert in one area (but a layman in another) will be able to build up knowledge in another field, eventually leading to cross-pollination of ideas. :)

I'll typically add in new ideas as posts, and once there is sufficient content I'll add them into the pages.
I'm still far from being an expert in these fields so do correct any mistakes if you spot any!
Enjoy reading, and hopefully this helps you [find your towel](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24779-a-towel-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-says-is).
