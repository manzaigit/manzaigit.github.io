I'm Yihao, a 1st year PhD student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I've done my undergraduate degrees (Business and Computer Science) in NTU as well.

My key research interests are within the intersection of Neuroscience and Computer Science, specifically **Multimodal Neuroimaging Analysis** and **Multiview Representation Learning**. 

Beyond academic interests, I like going for random walks, attending concerts and engaging in some futures thinking. I do have a habit of summarizing what I've observed and learnt - and that's why this blog exists today! :)

## About this blog

This blog is a compilation of what I've learnt during my time in University. The amount of content that we have to go through in our years in University can be overwhelming at times and after graduation, many of us do not remember much about what we've learnt. Thus, the ultimate goal is to create a concise point of reference (e.g. content summaries) from which I can re-visit concepts that I've learnt. The summaries will include short notes about stuff I've learnt, links that I've found useful and my thoughts on various areas, grouped into 3 pillars:

**AI**
* Math (just enough to understand the other topics well)
* Data Analytics and Machine Learning (theory and practice in businesses)
* Deep Learning Applications

**Brains**
* Workflows in Brain Image Analysis

**Foresights**
* Entrepreneurship (Design Thinking, Idea to Product, Financing)
* Education (Study Strategies, Teaching Paradigms, Shaping Thoughts)
* Sustainability and Green Financing 

Each page will be regularly updated, and posts will be made when there's a significant update to one of the pages. Enjoy reading, and do correct any mistakes if you spot any! :)
