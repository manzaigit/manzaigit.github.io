Why is a PhD tough?

It seems like coursework (only 6 modules, deeper but it's only 6!)

Besides it, you have to do other stuff (e.g. research integrity, modules on English proficiency and teaching)
You'll need to come up with a proposal, find a thesis advisory committee

You'll probably need to work with the senior PhD students or Research Fellows in the lab

You have your own thesis work

if you do cross-disciplinary work, a lot of things to catch up on 

Papers take a long time to produce because
- you need to create everything yourself: figures, tables, equations (latex is a pain)
- many experiments need to be done for robustness, and to defend your ideas

 In 1961, de Solla Price noticed that the number of scientists was doubling roughly every 15 years. My data show that since 1961, this rate has slowed down slightly, with a doubling roughly every 18 years. Still growing pretty freakinâ€™ fast.
