There are two main ways to view the integration of AI and Neuroscience.
* AI
* Neuroscience-inspired AI 

At present, 


Accelerating few-shot learning in NN: if predict correctly (during training), get an additional bonus / boost / heavier weight / increase in LR for that mini-epoch(?) but this boost should be limited i.e. decay quickly, decay can be a hyperparameter \[facilitation\]

N has ST/LT synaptic plasticity, but NN is static.
- N receives information continuously, decays continuously too
- NN receives information very intensively and does not change thereafter (there's no continual input?)


What do you need to create 'terminator'
- Advanced robotics system with accurate senses and fine motor control to interact with environment 
- Sustainable power source to run computational engines (GPU/TPU) + receptors and effectors
- Sufficent memory storage to keep data
- Repair itself from wear and tear (knowing when it will break down, creating the replacement and performing the replacement)
