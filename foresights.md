Forecasts and predictions of the future are often not accurate. However, we still do so to have a sense of security and to decide what is the best decision to make, given the information that we have presently derived. 

One hypothesis is that for many problems we face in life, there are just too many factors to consider. We don't have enough priors to make a precise estimation that stands a good chance to be correct.

Instead of aiming to get a perfect prediction, it might be more effective (at least for now) to consider the various scenarios that are possible, i.e. scenario planning.
