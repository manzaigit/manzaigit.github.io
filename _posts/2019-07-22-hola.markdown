Somehow I feel that we’re the generation that are in between traditional ML and DL. 
There’s probably a lot we don’t know about traditional ML as compared to our 'seniors'. How many of the 'younger generation' can claim to have a good understanding of both? Are they both important? Should we just learn DL and extend it? 
They’ll probably tell us to know some ML, since they understand it pretty well.

And we started at a bad time (~2016) when Tensorflow was hard to crack, Caffe was a pain to set up.
